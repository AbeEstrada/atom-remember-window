## Remember Window

Remember the window size, position and tree view width

### Install

<strike>`apm install remember-window`</strike>

# Note

This package isn't useful anymore, Atom now has this functionality in the core.

I'm going to leave the repository but I'm going to unpublish from the Atom packages list.
